### Voltage Divider Principle

Integrated a custom-made keypad consisting of 12 push buttons arranged in a 4x3 matrix configuration. This keypad provides user input for text entry on an ESP32 microcontroller.

To efficiently capture button presses and translate them into usable data, used a voltage divider circuit and analog GPIO pins. Specifically, 12 push buttons are connected to the ESP32 through 6 resistors arranged in a voltage divider network. This arrangement allows us to detect the analog voltage values corresponding to each button press. Make sure to calibrate the analog values for the button rows. (0-4095)

By analyzing the voltage levels at the input pins, we can uniquely identify which button has been pressed based on the predefined voltage thresholds associated with each button.

### Power Supply

We used a 2S Lipo battery for the power supply of the device. However, since the LoRa module cannot handle more than 3.3V, we had to convert the voltage to 3.3V using a buck module.

### OLED User Interface

The device incorporates an OLED screen to provide a user-friendly interface. When buttons are pressed, the corresponding characters are registered and stored. These characters are then displayed on the OLED screen in real time, providing the user with immediate feedback.

### Measuring Power Consumption with INA219

To monitor power consumption, we've integrated the INA219 current sensor. This sensor allows precise measurement of voltage, current, and power consumption. The collected data provides insights into the device's energy efficiency and aids in optimizing power usage.

### 433MHz Spring Type Antenna

For optimal performance in the 433MHz frequency range, we've employed a spring type antenna. This design choice enhances the communication range and signal strength, especially in open spaces.

### Device Selection and Messaging

The device allows users to select a specific device for sending messages. Through the user interface, users can navigate and choose a target device. The messaging process is seamless, with the selected characters displayed on the OLED screen and transmitted using LoRa technology.
